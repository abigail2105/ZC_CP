summed rarity
      "summed average rarity fraction (100/frequency in the data set) of all
      under represented features"

maxcontrib
      "sum of contributions to full representation
      (contribution = area of each feature that would narrow the gap
       between the target area and the currently represented area)"

max pccontrib
	"sum of contributions (as in maxcontrib) expressed as
       	percentages of site area"

max rarcontrib
      "sum of contributions (as in maxcontrib) for under-represented
       feature(s) with highest rarity fractions (100/frequency in the data set)"

mostcontrib
      "number of under-represented features that would be fully
       represented with the notional reservation of the sites"

next rarest
      "highest rarity fraction (100/frequency in the data set) of any
       under represented feature"

weighted maxcontrib
      "sum of contributions (as in maxcontrib) weighted by the rarity
       fraction (100/frequency in the data set) of each feature"

weighted propcontrib
      "sum of weighted contributions (as in weighted maxcontrib) but
       with contributions expressed as a percentage of the remaining area
       of each feature still to be represented"

weighted max pccontrib
	"sum of contributions (as in maxcontrib) expressed as
       	percentages of site area"
      	(And weight each value by feature richness before accumulating it for each site.)
