Software Limitations

- limitations in early stages that were remedied

  16-bit MS Windows 3.1 -> 32-bit MS WinNT/95/etc,
    most parts of program ran at least 100% faster with this improvement.
  Optimised data structures and execution time in several stages,
    now uses much less memory and runs much faster.
  Only worked with WinERMS, now works with ArcView, enhanced selection,
    mapping and zooming of sites.
  Improved interfaces in C-Plan for enhanced display and selection.
  Irrep predictor improved in several stages (EMR -> SF3 -> SF4 -> SF4hybrid).
  SUMIRR weightings added to account for limitations in SUMIRR.

- remaining limitations for further work

  Spatial module from Simon & Bill for spatial calculations.
  Corridor calculator from Michael.
  Parallel processing to increase performance on large datasets (many C-Plan
    methods are amenable to parallelism).
  Further improvements to ArcView and C-Plan interfaces to improve display
    and selection.
  Selection log database, store this information using better method.
  User defined tenure at run time (ie. allow tenure to change at run time).
  Optimise minset.
  Optimise site database.
  Fix known bugs from bug list.
  Private land issues to be resolved and integrated.
