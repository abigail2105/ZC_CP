To install C-Plan 32 bit version and use with ArcView 3.


1. Uninstall any previous version of CPlan32 with
"Add/Remove Programs".

2. Run the BDE32 installation set if you do not have the Borland Databse
Engine installed on your system.

3. Run the CPlan32 installation set to install C-Plan 32.

4. Copy the cplan.avx file from the directory where it has been installed 
(which is E:\Program Files\CPlan32\ArcView\cplan.avx on my system) to the
path where ArcView 3.0 can recognise it
(which is E:\ESRI\AV_GIS30\ARCVIEW\EXT32 on my system)

5. Start ArcView, and load the C-Plan extension from the Extensions dialog
(use the Project GUI, File|Extensions... dialog box to load the extension)

6. Create a new View  NOTE: The name of your view must be specified in
the INI file on the database path where your data is located.
ie. The section should look like this;
[ArcView]
ShapeTable=v890.dbf
View=View1
Theme=v890.shp

You will just have to modify the 'View' setting to have the same name
as the view you have just created.

7. Add the Shape theme to your view (which is v890.shp for the
Urbenville dataset)

8. Select the theme in the ArcView view legend bar by clicking on it.

9. Click the running man icon to start C-Plan.
